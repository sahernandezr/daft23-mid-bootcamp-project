# Mid-Bootcamp project planning 


## Scenario 

Your goal is to perform an end-to-end analysis putting into practice your statistical, data visualization and regression knowledge and present your project to an audience, accommodating to constraints of time.

## Expected deliverables

- Project management dashboard (Kanban [example](https://trello.com/b/FprQ67UI/daft-mini-project-1-game) or Trello board [example](https://trello.com/b/0SuyFNUA), spreadsheet on Google Sheets or Excel, etc) 
- Deck: Use templates found on [slides.com](https://slides.com/) or [canva.com](https://www.canva.com/) or make your own on PowerPoint or Keynote. **No more than 10 slides**
- Presentation: 5 minutes
- Tableau Dashboard
- Organized repository with folder and file structure ([example 1](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:828/format:webp/1*7votQbmArQop0uN8WsTVpw.png), [example 2](https://miro.medium.com/max/366/1*06aeJgtJ4c4mUQOG3qIbCw.png), [example 3](https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*YzcIXP0W-hi9B50ajKhFrg.webp)) that includes:

    -README file: This markdown will explain the data analysis workflow including the problem statement and/or the business the objective, data extraction, data wrangling, etc. Here you should explain the business analytic approach you used to solve the problem. Please be detailed in explaining the steps you followed. It is important to keep in mind that the document is written for the readers, who may or may not have the technical expertise with Python/SQL/Tableau.
    
    -SQL queries file
    
    -Python code file (.py or ipynb): The Python code should be well documented with comments, explaining the code, EDA (exploratory data analysis) operations, logic used - especially with data cleaning operations, and any assumptions followed in the model.
    
    -Database or databases used
    
    -Link to Tableau dashboard
    
## Some other tips

- Organize your files in folders with appropriate names
- Do not include code snippets in the README file
- Explain the business insights and the regression/classification model results
- Explain the future scope of work
- Make daily commits to the repo

## What will be used to assess your work:
- Critical Thinking
- Communication
- Transparency
- Thoroughness

## Tips & Tricks
- Organize yourself (don’t get lost!). Respect deadlines.
- Ask for help but don’t forget that Google is your friend.
- Consult documentation.
- Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you.
- Document your work.
- Learn about the problem and what research has been done before you.
- Before adding a graph to your presentation, think about what you want to represent.

## Proposed timeline
**Before Tuesday**
* Select your database (or at least narrow your choices to a couple)
* Define your goal
* Create your repo on Github with a README file and clone it to your computer. 
* Keep all your working files inside that folder and commit often. Folder structure is your friend!

**Tuesday** 
* Explore the data
* Including, but not limited to, describing data, data cleaning, data pre-processing (scaling, encoding, etc)
* Create your presentation outline: list the general ideas you want to include
* Create your deck outline: list the slides you plan to use and the graphs you would want to include

**Wednesday**
* Visualize data
* Use Tableau to visually explore the data further. Create and publish your Tableau dashboard.
* Work on your README
* First rehearsal: run a mock-up presentation using your deck.

    -How long did it take?
    
    -What is missing?
    
    -What should be left-out?
    
    -Are your graphs clear for someone looking at them for the first time?
    
    -Do you have a compelling beginning, an interesting middle and an impactful end?

**Thursday**
* Build a Model. Actually, build several models and compare their accuracies to find the model that best fits your data
* Include your results in your presentation script and deck
* Complete your README file
* Add the finishing touches to your presentation script and deck
* Rehearse your presentation, check your time, see if everything you say is clear to you. Is there something you keep forgetting to say? Something that makes you stumble? Make a note and rehearse again. Ask someone to be your audience and give you feedback

**Friday** 

PRESENTATION DAY!
